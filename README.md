# HTML_CODE

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. 

HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
HTML consists of a series of elements.
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
HTML is supported in all kinds of browsers.
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
